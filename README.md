# FlexibleRichTextView

[中文版](README.zh-cn.md)

## Description
This library is used for showing various rich text, including LaTeX, images, codes, tables, and normal styles such as center, bold, italic and so on.

An interesting feature is, you can customize most tags as whatever you want.

It uses [CodeView](https://github.com/Softwee/codeview-android) to support code highlight, and [JLaTeXMath](https://github.com/mksmbrtsh/jlatexmath-android) (as well as [this fork](https://github.com/sixgodIT/JLaTexMath-andriod)) to support LaTeX.

The method to parse rich text is something like recursively descending. I'm open to PR that could improve performance, fix bugs and anything make this library better.

## Download

add in your root `build.gradle` :
````
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
````


then add
````
compile 'com.github.daquexian:FlexibleRichTextView:0.8.2'
````
in your app's `build.gradle`

## Usage

You need initialize JLaTeXMath for LaTeX rendering by command:
```
AjLatexMath.init(context); // init library: load fonts, create paint, etc.
```

If you want to use code classifier to auto language recognizing just add to your Application
```
// train classifier on app start
CodeProcessor.init(this);
```

To show rich text, just invoke `flexibleRichTextView.setText`, such as
```
String richText = "[h][center]hi![/center][/h]" +
                "[quote]This is quote[/quote]" +
                "[code]print(\"Hello FlexibleRichTextView!\")[/code]" +
                "Hello FlexibleRichTextView!\n" +
                "This is LaTeX:\n" +
                "$e^{\\pi i} + 1 = 0$";
flexibleRichTextView.setText(richText);
```

## Tags

You can see default tags in [this](https://github.com/daquexian/FlexibleRichTextView/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/daquexian/flexiblerichtextview/Tokenizer.java#L711). Try to customize your own tags by the series of  `set***Labels(String... labels)` methods.

* For image labels, `\w` represents width ,`\h` represents height and `\u` represents the url of image.

* For attachment labels, `\s` repersents attachment id.

* For color labels, `\s` represents color (e.g. red).

* For url labels, `\s` represents url.

* For quote labels, `\p` represents the id of the quoted content, `\m` represents the name of the person quoted.

For example, if you customize image label as `<img height=\h width=\w>\u</img>`, the text `<img height=200 width=100>https://example.img</img>` will be treated as a image, its height is 200, width is 100 and its url is https://example.img . And of course you can just customize image label as `<img>\u</img>`, then the original size of image will be respected.

## Attachment

This library support attachment. If there are attachments to show, create a class and inherit abstract class `Attachment`, then invoke `flexibleRichTextView.setText(String richText, List<Attachment> attachments)`.


If `attachment.isImage()` is true, the attachment will be shown as image, or it will be shown as a link (please implement `getText()` method whose return value is the link text, and `getUrl()` method whose return value is the url of image, see [Callbacks](#callbacks) for more information). Both images and links produced from attachments will be shown at the bottom of view.

If you need the attachment embedded in text, please implement `getAttachmentId()` method and provide the id in attachment tag.

For example, the default attachment tag is `[attachment:\s]`, where `\s` represents attachment id. So you should invoke
```
String textWithAttachment = "This is an attachment\n" +
                            "[attachment:3918dbe1ac]\n" +
                            "The attachment is above";
flexibleRichTextView.setText(textWithAttachment, attachmentList);
```

If the list `attachmentList` contains an attachment whose id equals `3918dbe1ac`, it will be shown embedded in text.

## Quote

You can not only customize the tags of `quote`, but also the layout of `QuoteView`.

The default layout is [this](https://github.com/daquexian/FlexibleRichTextView/blob/master/library/src/main/res/layout/default_quote_view.xml).

The root element of layout must be a `QuoteView` and the first child of it must be a `FrameLayout`. You can specify a button that takes the role of expanding or collapsing the QuoteView on click by adding `app:buttonId=your_button_id` in QuoteView. When the button is clicked, the `onButtonClick(View view, boolean collapsed)` method of `OnViewListener` will be invoked, you could modify the text of button or do other things according to the status of `QuoteView`.

## LaTeX
See [this](https://github.com/daquexian/FlexibleRichTextView/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/daquexian/flexiblerichtextview/Tokenizer.java#L339) for LaTeX tags. They cannot be customized temporarily.

## Table
The grammer for table is the same as [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables/), except for the pipes on either end of the table cannot be omitted.

## Callbacks
In interface `FlexibleRichTextView.OnViewClickListener`, three callbacks are declared, including `OnImgClick(ImageView imageView)`, `OnAttClick(Attachment attachment)` and `OnQuoteButtonClick(View view, boolean collapsed)`.

For attachments, if an attachment is shown as image, `OnImgClick` will be called when clicking the attachment, `OnAttClick` is only called when an attachment shown as link is clicked.
